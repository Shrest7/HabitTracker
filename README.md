### **Updating a habit:**

Here you can see a line of gray cells, they are colored this way to indicate a current day. 

Now you can start tracking your habits:
Let's say for example that you exercised at 9th of March, that you have a programming streak from 10th to 12th March and at 11th of March you did some studying.
Hence you can mark the following cells, by simply clicking on them:

If you wish to remove the mark of a cell, then you can simply click on it again.

There is also a possibility to scroll up and down, so that you can see how far your streak reaches.
